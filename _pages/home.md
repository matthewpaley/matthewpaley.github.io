# About me

I'm currently working at [DHL Supply Chain](http://openfieldlive.com/?lang=en) in Columbus, as a **Senior Business Data Analyst**.

---

I'm a huge sports fan, and love working on sports analytics projects in my free time. Most of my work is done using R for analysis, machine learning, and data viz, but I'm experienced in SQL and dabble in Python as well. (And I love to learn new skills!) 

You can view my resume [here](https://matthewpaley.github.io/resume/), and check about my different projects on my [projects page](https://matthewpaley.github.io/projects/). Here are a few projects that I'm proud of.
