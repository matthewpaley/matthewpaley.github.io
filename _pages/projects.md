## Work Projects

- **Cycle Count Optimization**: Built Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree model to predict warehouse locations with inventory discrepancies. Productionized model at pilot warehouse, resulting in projected $1 million saved in labor and inventory costs. Product is in process of being rolled out at 30+ warehouses around the USA.
- **Employee Turnover Model**: Implemented model to predict the likeliness that an employee will term. Insights were used to identify and help fix factors contributing to turnover.
