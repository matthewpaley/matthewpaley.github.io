# About me

I'm currently working at DHL Supply Chain in Columbus, Ohio. I'm part of a small team showing the value that data science can bring to an organization. 

---

I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio as a huge Browns fan. I graduated from The Ohio State University in 2018, where I majored in Management Information Systems and minored in business analytics. In my free time, I combine my passion for sports with what I learned in school and work on sports analytics projects.
