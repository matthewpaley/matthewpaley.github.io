Hi, I'm Matthew. I like using data to answer interesting questions. I'm a huge sports fan, and love working on sports analytics projects in my free time. Most of my work is done using R for analysis, machine learning, and data viz, but I'm experienced in SQL and dabble in Python as well. (And I love to learn new skills!)
